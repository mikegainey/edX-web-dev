* Module 1: My first web page

  Elements - the content
  Tags - around the elements
  Attributes - given inside the opening tag; basically assigns values to variables
  
  Comments: <!-- This is a comment -->
  
  <!DOCTYPE html> - the first thing in any HTML file; no closing tag
  
  <html> </html> - encloses all the HTML in a file

  Nearly every HTML document has two parts: 
  - <head> </head>   The 'head' comes before the 'body'. It is where you put information about the document that does not really go in the body, AKA 'meta-' information.
  - <body> </body>   The 'body' is the main content of the page, containing text, images, tables and so on. 

** HTML Character references -- to display characters reserved for HTML: <, >, &, "

   All HTML character references can be written using either a name, decimal number, or hex number.
   Examples: &nbsp; &#160; &#x00A0 (& name or number ;)

   The five special characters listed in the table below should always be written as character references if you want them to appear on your page when viewed by a reader:
  
| Symbol             | Entity Name | Entity Number | Usage                |
|--------------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------|
| Less than '<'      | &lt;        | &#60;         | Div tag: &lt;div>    |
| Greater than '>'   | &gt;        | &#62;         | Div tag: &lt;div&gt; |
| Ampersand '&'      | &amp;       | &#38;         | Tom &amp; Jerry      |
| Non-breaking space | &nbsp;      | &#160;        |                      |
| Quotes "           | &quot;      | &#34;         |                      |


if you wish to display this in your browser: <img src="images/test.png" alt="test image">
You have to write it like this in your HTML code:
&lt;img src=&quot;images/test.png&quot; alt=&quot;test image&quot;&gt;

* Module 2: Attributes, images and links

* Tags

  - <!doctype> - the DTD - Document Type Declaration.  It has no closing tag.  It is there to declare exactly what type of HTML the computer will find in this file. It is used as that: <!DOCTYPE html>

  - <html> - The html open and close tags wrap around nearly everything in your html file (except the doctype tag).  This essentially contains all of the HTML code in the file, which is generally everything (one big html element).

  - <head> - The head element is where you put information that does not really appear in the body of the work.  For example, the <title> of the page, which typically appears on the window containing the page, is defined in the head section.

  - <body> - The body section contains all of the content of your page, essentially what the user sees.  This could be text, pictures, links, videos, tables and so on.  In addition to the content, the body usually contains lots of other elements, each indicated by their own tags.

  - <h1> - There are a whole collection of 'h' tags, <h1>, <h2>, <h3> . . . all the way up to <h6>.  They're generally used the same way you would use chapter or section headings in a book.
    
  - <p> - P is for 'paragraph', which is how much of your text information might be arranged.  When rendered on the Web page, a p element will typically be a new line.

  - <q> - The q tag is for quotes.  It's used when you want to quote a person or written work in your Web page.  It is customarily displayed using quotation marks, again unrelated to strings. Thus <q>Brevity is beautiful</q> would be rendered as "Brevity is beautiful".

  - <blockquote> - If you want to quote a larger passage, you may want to use blockquote, which will typically set the quoted text apart from the surrounding text and indent it, to make clear that it is quoted text:

  - <ul>, <ol> - These two tags are used to indicate a list of things.  The only difference is that <ol> is an "ordered" list, meaning the elements are in a particular order, and it might be a good idea to number them.  The "u" in <ul> stands for "unordered" and is used for a list of things where the order doesn't really matter, so it is usually rendered as a bulleted list, or something else without numbers.

  - <li> - The li element is a "List Item", i.e. one item in the list.  As you might expect, this element only really makes sense nested inside a list (<ul> or <ol>).  In the final rendering, each li element would typically be preceded by a number or bullet, or something similar (but not necessarily).

  - <hr> - HR originally stood for "Horizontal Rule", a horizontal line across the width of the text.  It's still there in HTML5, but now is officially supposed to represent a "thematic break" in the content.

    <br> - This one signifies a line break.  For example it can be an easy way to make sure that lines of poetry break where they're supposed to.  It doesn't have a close tag.
    
  - <pre> - PRE stands for "PREformatted text", meaning "I've set this up just the way I want it, don't mess with it."  It generally implies a monospace font, and none of the spaces, tabs or carriage-returns are ignored.  It is very handy for illustrating bits of program code, or other "typewritten" material:
