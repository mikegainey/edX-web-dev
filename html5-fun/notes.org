* Module 1: My first web page

  Elements - the content
  Tags - around the elements
  Attributes - given inside the opening tag; basically assigns values to variables
  
  Comments: <!-- This is a comment -->
  
  <!DOCTYPE html> - the first thing in any HTML file; no closing tag
  
  <html> </html> - encloses all the HTML in a file

  Nearly every HTML document has two parts: 
  - <head> </head>   The 'head' comes before the 'body'. It is where you put information about the document that does not really go in the body, AKA 'meta-' information.
  - <body> </body>   The 'body' is the main content of the page, containing text, images, tables and so on. 

** HTML Character references -- to display characters reserved for HTML: <, >, &, "

   All HTML character references can be written using either a name, decimal number, or hex number.
   Examples: &nbsp; &#160; &#x00A0 (& name or number ;)

   The five special characters listed in the table below should always be written as character references if you want them to appear on your page when viewed by a reader:
  
| Symbol             | Entity Name | Entity Number | Usage                |
|--------------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------|
| Less than '<'      | &lt;        | &#60;         | Div tag: &lt;div>    |
| Greater than '>'   | &gt;        | &#62;         | Div tag: &lt;div&gt; |
| Ampersand '&'      | &amp;       | &#38;         | Tom &amp; Jerry      |
| Non-breaking space | &nbsp;      | &#160;        |                      |
| Quotes "           | &quot;      | &#34;         |                      |


if you wish to display this in your browser: <img src="images/test.png" alt="test image">
You have to write it like this in your HTML code:
&lt;img src=&quot;images/test.png&quot; alt=&quot;test image&quot;&gt;
